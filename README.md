# Statistics 101

Documentation for Statistics 101 Workshop, originally presented at DevOps Days Amsterdam 2015

### What you need before we get started

* R
* RStudio

To install the base program for R, please go to http://cran.r-project.org/ and click on the download link for your OS (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). On the page that opens, click on the link to the latest version download and install as one usually installs software.

To install RStudio, please go to http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ and click on the link for the open source desktop edition. Download the installer for your OS (again Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), install as one usually installs software.

If you want to try out the R language and Rstudio before we get started with the workshop, you could try Swirl, a package that lets you learn R within R: http://swirlstats.com/. However, the point of this workshop is not to become a pro user of R, it is to get a better understanding of Statistics. R is just the tool to get to that understanding.
